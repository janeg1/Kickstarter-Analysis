# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
We are given a large data file with columns from A-N, and rows 1-4115 that contains various information on Kickstarter campaigns for different art projects in different countries, with different goals, success rates, etc. Through various tools, charts, filters, formatting we need to size it down to be able to overview and to apply it, based on client’s requests and what type of information they are looking for.

### Purpose
Our client Louise is looking to get some information based on launch date and goal to compare to her own Kickstarter fundraiser that she launched in the past and came close to the goal of 12k. we will help her to get better idea and create visualization for better reading.

## Analysis and Challenges
Louise got lucky to raise almost close to her goal in a short period of time, because based on our research, 12k goal would have about 55% success rate. Perhaps having such a good luck and record, she can launch another fundraiser with a 35k goal, starting in April (through the summer).

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
 The Most successful campaigns were launched in February, April, May, June , July, August, peaking in May and then slowly descending through summer.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on what we see in this chart, we can say most successful campaigns started at less than a thousand, descending to 25k. and then 35k-45k also performed very well. the most unrealistic goals based on data provided were 25k to 30k, and 45k-50k.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I haven’t really run into any challenges (nothing that google couldn’t help with). May be some difficulties would be if we would run into some outliers (in pledge) for example, donors, like family members, wealthy people or companies. but we didn’t focus much on this or didn’t detect anything obvious.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 
Best to launch fundraiser late spring (April) through summer and dont start in November.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? 
Start with lower amount $.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Demographic data, as it can be important factor.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Graph that shows outliers in pledge category can be helpful to see if data was skewed. Also graph that shows Demographic by age (even though we didn’t have this data) can help in the future to understand how to target certain age groups better, as they tend to absorb information from different sources, example younger from digital world and social media, older from local newspapers, news channels, etc. 


### Note from me
i apologize in advance, i was not sure if i should link graphs here, as we included them in repository and if analysis should be longer or shorter. Thank you. Jane
